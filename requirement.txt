ERC-721 introduces a standard for Non-fungible Token (NFT). It is a very exciting sector that blockchain enables us to do so much more!

User Story

As an artist, I want to showoff my art piece on the blockchain where people can purchase my art knowing it is authentic.


Requirements
Write smart contracts in Solidity that mints 500 NFTs total. NFT is only minted when a buyer purchases the NFT. The price of the NFT increases as NFT supply decreases. Buyers can buy the NFTs with STMX or ETH.

Submission
Please create a feature branch for your work and when complete open a merge request, tagging GitLab user calvinh8 as the reviewer.

Timeline
Feel free to spend up-to 3 hours on the assignment. If you do go over the 3 hour mark, please note as much in your merge request. I do not watch the clock, but we expect honesty and transparency in our team and hold each other to those standards.

Acceptance Criteria

Solidity should be used for implementing smart contracts
Truffle should be used for setting up NFT project and testing
Unit tests with at least 80% coverage
Document all required steps to build and run the assignment


Bonus (in no particular order):

If you decide to do the bonus points, please document how much additional time you spend on implementing bonus points.


Use Chainlink or a similar oracle to get real-time pricing of STMX and ETH
Build or clone a simple, basic React dApp (such as Unisocks) that connects to web3 showcasing the image of the NFT buyers can buy, the quantity, and the payment option to complete the purchase. If dApp is cloned, please specify which project did you clone from
